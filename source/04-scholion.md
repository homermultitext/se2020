**Thursday, July 2**: editing *scholia* with TEI-compliant XML.


##  Major concepts

- recording non-textual features in a manuscript
- using URNs to index related content


## Break-out session



(The session host will always begin by pulling to sync with the most recent work in your repository.)

Before you begin:

- review where you are in the *Iliad*. What is happening in the first lines of your page?
- organize your team the same way you did to edit *Iliad* text, but in addition at least one member of your team should have these pages open for easy reference:
    - instructions for [how to index a scholion marker](https://github.com/neelsmith/transmission-evolution/wiki/Recording-non-textual-features)
    - summary of HMT project's TEI markup on our [reference page](https://homermultitext.github.io/se2020/references/)

As you edit your first scholion, feel free to message for consultation with people in other breakout teams.





Then:

1. create a DSE record for the first *scholion* on your page (in your repository's `dse` directory).
2. index the marker for your *scholion* (in the `collections-data` directory)
3. edit the text of the first scholon (and *only* the first scholion!)
4. validate and verify your work so far.  

If everything goes well, your updated DSE reports should now show that you have one corretly indexed scholion, in addition to any *Iliad* lines you edited yesterday.

Your team should spend the last 5-10 minutes preparing to present your work to the plenary group on Friday, when we'll look at *scholia* together.  To present your *scholion*, be prepared to tell us:

- what page of the manuscript you are reading
- what line of the *Iliad* it comments on, and summarize briefly what is happening at that point in the *Iliad*
- if your *scholion* has a *lemma*
- if your *scholion* has a corresponding marker in the *Iliad* text, and if so what word or phrase it is attached to
- anything you were able to work out about the syntax and meaning of the scholion


## Return to plenary session

Your team should be prepared to summarize your work today. What was the most challenging part of editing your scholion?

On Friday, your team will present your scholion to the whole group in more detail.

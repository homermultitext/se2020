**Tuesday, June 30**:  an explicit model for digital scholarly editions



## Assignment for break-out sessions

Things you'll need:


- a Greek text of the *Iliad* with canonical book/line identifiers
- the canonical citation of the first *Iliad* line on your assigned page (from yesterday's meeting)
- the form of URNs for your manuscript's pages, and for your *Iliad* text (available on the [references page](https://homermultitext.github.io/se2020/references/))

If you're new to indexing DSE records, you can refer to [this overview](https://github.com/neelsmith/transmission-evolution/wiki/DSE-indexing) (also linked from the  [references page](https://homermultitext.github.io/se2020/references/)).


### Assignment

(The session host will always begin by *pulling* to sync with the most recent work in  your repository.)

1. Index the first two lines of the *Iliad* on your page.  Validate and verify your work.
2. Index all the *Iliad* lines on your page, validating and verifying as often as you need.

When you have validated and verified multiple lines, your session host will *push* your work to your repository.


### Bonus

If you complete all the DSE indexing of the *Iliad* on your assigned page of the Upsilon 1.1 manuscript, you may repeat the same process to index the *Iliad* text on the corresponding page of the Venetus B manuscript.

## Return to plenary session

One member of your team (*not* a faculty member, or Holy Cross summer research student) will be prepared to summarize what your team did.  Were there any parts of the process that were especially difficult in a Zoom breakout room? Do you have any tips or tricks your team found helpful?

The session host should be prepared to screen share a visual verification of completeness of coverage for your page.

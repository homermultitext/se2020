**Monday, June 29**:  meet your team (and your manuscript)


## Assignment for break-out sessions

1. Meet each member of your team.  Find out one amazing detail about each person that you can share when you introduce your team to the plenary group.
2. Meet your manuscript.  Look at the [first page assigned to your team](https://homermultitext.github.io/se2020/teams/).  Find the first line of the *Iliad* on your page, and match its Greek text with any print or online version of *Iliad* 23 to find its *canonical reference*, expressed as **book and line**.


### Bonus

- At least one or two members of your team know what a `CtsUrn` is.  Use [this refernence page](https://homermultitext.github.io/se2020/references/) to find the URN for your specific version of the *Iliad*, and express the first line of *Iliad* on your page as a CtsUrn.

## Return to plenary session


- One member of your team (*not* a faculty member, or Holy Cross summer research student) will introduce to the whole group each member of your team, and share in the Zoom chat stream the line number where your editing work will begin on Tuesday.  (Bonus if you express this as a CtsUrn!)

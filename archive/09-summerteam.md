**Thursday, July 9**: Some things people are doing with your editions




## Major ideas

- traditional ideas of *vertical* and *horizontal variation* reflect multiformity in tradition.  Can we explore those concepts more systematically with digital editions?
- *topic modelling* measures *recurring patterns of co-occurring terms*
- *scholia* are not a fixed genre of mechanically copied texts.  Can we use topic  modelling to trace transmission of texts that are reused and modified?


## Break-out session

Like yesterday, we won't reassemble as a full group.

Continue to work on your assigned page, in whatever work flow your team chooses.  If your team has a short page and you finish your work, look at the corresponding page of the Venetus B manuscript.


## Preparing for tomorrow

Would you like to continue working with the HMT project in some fashion? Bring any/all ideas to tomorrow's closing discussion!

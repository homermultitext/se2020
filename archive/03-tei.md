**Wednesday, July 1**: editing the *Iliad* with TEI-compliant XML.


##  Major concepts

- markup: because writing systems are not transcriptions of speech
- *semantic* markup, not *presentational* markup
- HMT markup encodes the *canonical citation*
- HMT uses markup to disambiguate *named entities*



Technical notes:

- XML syntax: *elements*, *attributes*, *text content*
- HMT uses a subset of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
- HMT organizes markup in 4 tiers (see [summary on reference page](https://homermultitext.github.io/se2020/references/))


## Break-out session


(The session host will always begin by pulling to sync with the most recent work in your repository.)


### Organizing your team

- the session host will open the XML text of the *Iliad* in Atom, and share a teletype key with everyone in the group in the Zoom chat stream
- everyone with Atom and teletype installed can use the key to view and help edit the XML document
- one team member can use Zoom to share a window with the image of your page
- one member of your team can take the lead in looking up URNs for any *named entities* you need to identify

You are all strongly encouraged to read each line aloud in mellifluous dactylic hexameter.

## Assignment

Edit one line of the *Iliad*.  Validate and verify your text.  In addition to checking the DSE validation that you looked at yesterday, you should evalute the validation and verification results for tests of character set usage.

After you validate and verify one line, continue editing the *Iliad* text on your page.  Keep your DSE records up to date with your XML edition.


## Return to plenary session

One member of your team (*not* a faculty member, or Holy Cross summer research student) will be prepared to summarize what your team did. Were there any parts of the process that were especially difficult in a Zoom breakout room? Do you have any tips or tricks your team found helpful?

Were there particular problems reading the paleography of the manuscript?  Any questions or tips about reading the *Iliad* text that you can share with others?

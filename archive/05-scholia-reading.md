**Friday, July 3**: reading *scholia*.

## Major concepts

- to end a work session:
    1. make sure you can build a citable library from your repository
    2. push all your work to github
- *scholia* are hard

## Plenary session

We'll spend more time today in our plenary session, as we collectively look at a scholion from each team.

To orient the whole group, each team should be prepared to share with us in the chat stream:

- what page of the manuscript you are reading
- what line of the Iliad your scholion comments on

Your team should then:

- share a screen with the scholion
- summarize briefly what is happening at that point in the *Iliad*
- tell us if your scholion has a corresponding marker in the Iliad text, and if so what word or phrase it is attached to
- tell us whether your reaing differed from Erbse or Dindorf
- summarize anything your group was able to figure out about the syntax and sense of the *scholion*



## Break-out sessions

We will reserve 15 minutes for teams to return to break-out rooms to validate and verify their work, and tidy up any work they wish to continue.

*As always*, before ending your team's session, you should:

1. ensure that you can build a citable library from repository.
2. commit and push any changes you have made


## Looking ahead

Beginning Monday, your teams will work steadily through the four tasks of editing your page:

1. index *Iliad* lines
2. edit *Iliad* lines
3. index *scholia*
4. edit *scholia*

You may opt to complete tasks successively (first indexing all *Iliad* lines, next editing all *Iliad* lines, etc.), or work on them in parallel. For example, you might index and edit a few *Iliad* lines, then index and edit all *scholia* commenting on those lines; or index all *Iliad* lines and *scholia*, then edit  one section of the page.  What do you think would be the most effective use of your team's work time in break-out rooms next week?

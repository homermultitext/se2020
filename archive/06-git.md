**Monday, July 6**: organizing work teams.


## Major questions

- validation and verification empowers teams to experiment with processes:  as long as your work is in teams and your work is validated and verified, you're free to find the best work flow for your group


## Break-out session

A new session host should begin your work today by pulling on your team's github respository  (or if it's her first time working with the repository, by cloning it).  Share your screen in Zoom so that your teammates can watch, learn or help. Then, she should start a docker session.

Throughout this week, your teams will continue with the same tasks of editing your page you worked through last week:

1. index *Iliad* lines
2. edit *Iliad* lines
3. index *scholia*
4. edit *scholia* (including indexing scholion markers)

You may opt to complete tasks successively (first indexing all *Iliad* lines, next editing all *Iliad* lines, etc.), or work on them in parallel. For example, you might index and edit a few *Iliad* lines, then index and edit all *scholia* commenting on those lines; or index all *Iliad* lines and *scholia*, then edit  one section of the page.

Be sure that you allow enough time to validate and verify your work at the end of the break out session.

Before returning to the plenary group, you should:

1. be sure you can still build a citable library from your repository, and then
2. push your work to github



## Return to plenary session

Share with the entire group how your team decided to approach your next editing work.  Did it work as you expected? Are there things you want to change tomorrow?

**Thursday, July 9**: Our programmed summer experience ends today.  How should the HMT project move forward from here?


## Questions



Would you like to continue taking part in the Homer Multitext project in some fashion?


### What should we do?


Would any of these activities appeal to you?

- working in small work groups (3-5) to edit material as you've done over the past two weeks, and perhaps preparing to present a scholion you've worked on at other digital venues
- dropping in for periodic scholia reading parties (8-10 times a year?)
- occasional "show and tell" sessions where one or more teams present work in progress for discussion and critique
- perhaps a summer Homer Multitext (virtual) conference, with call for submissions and reviewed content, and on-line events open to the public


### Who should we connect with?

How do we meet, connect with and recruit new HMT contributors?

How do we foster connections among contributors at different institutions?

How do we stay in touch with alumni, many of whom have busy lives outside academia?

Can we make the multidisciplinary work of the HMT project compelling to and connect with people beyond the field of Classics?

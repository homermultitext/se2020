**Tuesday, July 7**: validating and verifying your work.


## Major ideas

- "see one, do one, teach one" (traditional method of teaching surgery)

## Break-out session

Today, we won't return to the full group.

Our goals for break-out sessions are:

- someone who is *not* the HMT faculty member who hosted last week try to host the session
- continue to work on your assigned page, in whatever work flow your team chooses.  Consider whether ideas you heard from other teams yesterday might be helpful to your team.
- be sure to allow time to validate and push before quitting


Each team should identify *one* observation you want to share with the whole group tomorrow (Wednesday). This could be:


- something interesting you saw in your manuscript
- something you figured out about how your team could work more effectively
- something you don't understand or want other HMT people to look at

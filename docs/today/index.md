**Wednesday, July 8**: Q/A.


## Major ideas

- standards for validation+verification give teams freedom to define their own work practices

## Break-out session

Like yesterday, we won't reassemble as a full group.  When your group finishes for the day, however, please save a couple of minutes to return to the main Zoom session, and summarize what your team did.

Our goals for today's break-out sessions are:

- someone who is *not* the HMT faculty member who hosted last week try to host the session
- continue to work on your assigned page, in whatever work flow your team chooses.
- be sure to allow time to validate and push before quitting
